        Scenario 1: "How can I find and book tickets for my favorite events?" A
        visitor, Lisa, is looking for an easy way to book tickets for an
        upcoming concert. She lands on the website and sees a search bar on the
        homepage where she types the artist’s name. The website displays a list
        of upcoming concerts with details like date, venue, and ticket
        availability. Lisa clicks on the event, views the interactive seating
        chart, selects her preferred seat, and proceeds to checkout. After
        payment, she receives a confirmation email with her e-ticket.
